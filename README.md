# Hi, I'm Leslie 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a beginner on an exciting journey into the world of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

---

## What I'm Working Toward

My goal is to build a strong foundation in AI/ML, understanding how intelligent systems learn, make decisions, and solve real-world problems. I'm focused on growing from the ground up, one project at a time.

Some areas I'm especially excited about:
-  Machine Learning fundamentals
-  Neural networks & deep learning
-  Data analysis & visualization
-  Building AI-powered apps and tools

---

##  Currently Learning

- Python (the backbone of AI/ML)
- Core ML concepts: data, models, training, and evaluation
- Tools like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn
- How to turn ideas into real projects

---

##  My Journey

I'm just getting started, and this GitHub is where I'll document everything:  the projects, the experiments, the mistakes, and the wins. Every commit is a step forward.

 "Every expert was once a beginner."
